PrimeScore
==========

Welcome to PrimeScore's documentation.

PrimeScore is a Flask and PostgreSQL football statistics application built around API-Football. It lets users register, log in, manage favourites, view live matches, check fixtures and results, browse league tables, compare teams and players, and manage profile and notification settings from one browser-based dashboard.

This README is written as a GitHub-friendly documentation page. It is meant to help a new teammate, marker, or developer understand:

* what the project does
* how to install and run it
* which requirements it implements
* how the files connect to each other
* where the important logic lives
* how the project is tested

Requirements
------------

PrimeScore currently depends on:

* Python 3.10 or newer
* PostgreSQL running locally
* an API-Football API key

Tech stack:

* Python
* Flask
* PostgreSQL
* HTML
* CSS
* vanilla JavaScript
* API-Football (``https://v3.football.api-sports.io``)

Environment variables used by the app:

Required:

* ``FOOTBALL_API_KEY``

Usually needed:

* ``DB_HOST``
* ``DB_NAME``
* ``DB_USER``
* ``DB_PASSWORD``
* ``DB_PORT``

Optional:

* ``SECRET_KEY``
* ``CURRENT_SEASON``
* ``FLASK_DEBUG``

Default database values in ``config.py``:

* host: ``localhost``
* database: ``primescore``
* user: ``postgres``
* port: ``5432``


Installation
------------

1. Open the project folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: powershell

   cd C:\path\to\primescore


2. Create a virtual environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: powershell

   py -m venv .venv


3. Activate the virtual environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: powershell

   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1


4. Install dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: powershell

   pip install -r requirements.txt


5. Create the PostgreSQL database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: powershell

   psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE primescore;"


6. Load the schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: powershell

   psql -U postgres -d primescore -f db\schema.sql


7. Set environment variables for the current PowerShell session
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: powershell

   $env:FOOTBALL_API_KEY="YOUR_API_FOOTBALL_KEY"
   $env:DB_HOST="localhost"
   $env:DB_NAME="primescore"
   $env:DB_USER="postgres"
   $env:DB_PASSWORD="YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD"
   $env:DB_PORT="5432"


Running the app
---------------

Start the server from the project root:

.. code-block:: powershell

   python app.py

Then open:

* ``http://127.0.0.1:5000``
* or ``http://localhost:5000``

The app runs on port ``5000`` because ``app.py`` explicitly starts Flask with:

.. code-block:: python

   app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000, debug=debug_mode)


Version control
---------------

Suggested Git workflow for the repository:

.. code-block:: powershell

   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd primescore
   git checkout -b feature/short-description

Good practice for this project:

* keep commits focused on one feature or bug fix
* write clear commit messages
* avoid committing ``.venv``, ``__pycache__``, local coverage files, or local editor folders
* run the automated test suite before pushing

Typical commands:

.. code-block:: powershell

   git add .
   git commit -m "Add favourites route tests and update matrix"
   git push origin feature/short-description


Definitions
-----------

A. User account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A PrimeScore account stores:

* username
* email
* password hash
* optional display name
* optional bio


B. Favourite team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A favourite team is a club selected by the user so the app can show team-focused fixtures, results, live matches, and comparisons.


C. Favourite player
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A favourite player is a player selected by the user so the app can show player cards and player statistics on the home screen and in comparison tools.


D. Favourite league
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A favourite league is a saved competition such as the Premier League, Serie A, or La Liga. Favourite leagues drive the league-table section and can also be cycled on the home page.


E. Match
~~~~~~~~

A match is a fixture returned by API-Football. Depending on status, it may be:

* live
* not started
* finished


F. Statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Statistics are football-specific values returned by API-Football or derived from returned fixtures, such as:

* goals
* assists
* appearances
* wins
* draws
* losses
* clean sheets


Requirement 1: Manage user accounts
-----------------------------------

Users must be able to create and use accounts securely.

Implemented behaviour:

* users can register new accounts
* users can log in with existing credentials
* users can log out
* the app keeps session state for authenticated use
* the app identifies first-time users based on empty favourites
* users can request password reset messaging

Consequences or side-effects:

* session-based authentication means protected API routes check ``session["user_id"]``
* registration also seeds default favourites and notification settings rows

Main code:

* ``app.py``
* ``routes/authentication_routes.py``
* ``templates/pages/login_page.html``
* ``static/js/auth_handlers.js``


Requirement 2: Manage favourites
--------------------------------

Users must be able to save and update favourite teams, players, and leagues.

Implemented behaviour:

* users can save up to 5 favourite teams
* users can save up to 10 favourite players
* users can save up to 3 favourite leagues
* favourites are stored with both IDs and display names
* favourites are returned as safe empty lists when logged out

Consequences or side-effects:

* favourites drive parts of the home screen
* player favourites depend on team-aware player resolution when needed

Main code:

* ``routes/favourites_routes.py``
* ``routes/lookup_routes.py``
* ``templates/pages/favourites_page.html``
* ``static/js/favourites_handlers.js``


Requirement 3: Show a personalised home screen
----------------------------------------------

The home screen should show meaningful football data before and after favourites are chosen.

Implemented behaviour:

* before favourites are saved, the home screen defaults to a general Premier League view
* after favourites are saved, the home screen can use favourite teams, favourite players, and favourite leagues
* favourite player cards appear on the home page when player favourites exist
* favourite league tables can be switched with arrows

Consequences or side-effects:

* this route coordinates several data sources, so it is one of the most important orchestration points in the app
* it is also affected most by API plan limits and quota limits

Main code:

* ``routes/favourites_routes.py``
* ``templates/pages/home_page.html``
* ``static/js/home_page_handlers.js``


Requirement 4: Show live matches fixtures and results
-----------------------------------------------------

Users should be able to see current and recent football matches.

Implemented behaviour:

* live matches come from the API-Football ``fixtures?live=all`` flow
* fixtures are returned through ``/api/fixtures``
* results are returned through ``/api/results``
* routes support league-based and team-based filtering

Consequences or side-effects:

* these flows depend heavily on API availability and plan restrictions
* the frontend needs clear fallback handling when the API returns no data

Main code:

* ``routes/match_routes.py``
* ``templates/pages/live_page.html``
* ``templates/pages/fixtures_page.html``
* ``templates/pages/results_page.html``
* ``static/js/match_page_handlers.js``


Requirement 5: Show league standings
------------------------------------

Users should be able to view current league tables.

Implemented behaviour:

* standings are retrieved using mapped league codes
* the backend formats raw API-Football standings into a UI-friendly shape
* the home page and leagues page both use standings data

Consequences or side-effects:

* the app uses internal codes like ``PL``, ``SA``, ``PD``, and ``BL1`` and translates them to API league IDs

Main code:

* ``routes/statistics_routes.py``
* ``services/football_api_client.py``
* ``templates/pages/leagues_page.html``
* ``static/js/league_search_handlers.js``


Requirement 6: Show team and player statistics
----------------------------------------------

Users should be able to inspect football statistics for teams and players.

Implemented behaviour:

* player statistics are fetched by player ID and season
* team statistics prefer official ``teams/statistics`` API data
* advanced FR7 metrics such as possession, shots, shots on target, fouls, and corners are enriched from recent finished-match statistics
* a dedicated Statistics page lets users inspect team and player stats outside the compare view
* home-page favourite-player cards display quick player stats

Consequences or side-effects:

* statistics quality depends on the external API and the free-plan limits
* player search by name often needs team context to resolve correctly

Main code:

* ``routes/statistics_routes.py``
* ``services/football_api_client.py``
* ``templates/pages/home_page.html``
* ``templates/pages/compare_page.html``
* ``static/js/comparison_handlers.js``


Requirement 7: Search and compare football data
-----------------------------------------------

Users should be able to search for leagues, teams, and players, then compare relevant data.

Implemented behaviour:

* team names can be resolved to team IDs
* player names can be resolved to player IDs, often using team context
* leagues can be resolved from user-typed names or short codes
* team and player comparison flows depend on those resolvers
* the compare page and the dedicated Statistics page both reuse the same resolution helpers

Consequences or side-effects:

* lookup is one of the most important shared systems because the UI works with names but the API mostly works with IDs
* shared frontend memoization plus backend resolver caching now reduce repeated team and player searches
* fuzzy matching and safe error handling make the UI more usable

Main code:

* ``routes/lookup_routes.py``
* ``routes/statistics_routes.py``
* ``templates/pages/compare_page.html``
* ``static/js/comparison_handlers.js``
* ``static/js/league_search_handlers.js``


Requirement 8: Manage profile and notification settings
-------------------------------------------------------

Users should be able to edit their own account details and preferences.

Implemented behaviour:

* users can update username, email, display name, and bio
* users can change password
* users can save notification preference booleans
* default notification settings are returned if no settings row exists yet

Consequences or side-effects:

* profile updates also update session values where needed
* notification preferences are stored, but real push delivery is not implemented

Main code:

* ``routes/profile_routes.py``
* ``routes/notification_routes.py``
* ``templates/pages/profile_page.html``
* ``templates/pages/settings_page.html``
* ``static/js/profile_handlers.js``
* ``static/js/notification_handlers.js``


Architecture and data flow
--------------------------

PrimeScore follows a simple 3-layer structure:

1. Presentation layer

   * HTML templates
   * CSS
   * JavaScript handlers

2. Application layer

   * Flask routes and orchestration logic

3. Data and integration layer

   * PostgreSQL
   * API-Football

Typical request flow:

.. code-block:: text

   Browser UI
     -> JavaScript handler
     -> Flask route (/api/...)
     -> DB lookup and/or API-Football call
     -> response formatting
     -> JSON returned to frontend
     -> UI updated in the page

The biggest connection points in the system are:

* ``app.py``

  * creates the Flask app
  * registers all blueprints
  * serves ``dashboard_page.html``

* ``routes/lookup_routes.py``

  * converts typed team, player, and league names into IDs and caches successful resolutions

* ``routes/favourites_routes.py``

  * builds and short-term caches personalised ``/api/home-screen`` payloads

* ``routes/statistics_routes.py``

  * serves standings plus cached team and player statistics payloads

* ``services/football_api_client.py``

  * centralizes external API requests, caching, fallback handling, and formatting

* ``db/connection.py``

  * centralizes DB access through pooled connections and ``DBContext``


Code map
--------

This section is the closest equivalent to the "Login page - main.dart" style module list in your example, but adapted to PrimeScore.

Application entry point - ``app.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key responsibilities:

* create the Flask app
* apply configuration from ``config.py``
* register all route blueprints
* serve the main dashboard shell
* define basic HTTP error handlers


Configuration - ``config.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key responsibilities:

* read environment variables
* store database config
* store session/cookie config
* store the active football API base URL, key, timeout, and season


Database layer - ``db/connection.py``, ``db/schema.sql``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``db/connection.py``

* sets up PostgreSQL connection pooling
* provides ``get_db_connection()``
* provides ``release_db_connection()``
* provides ``DBContext`` for safe commit/rollback handling

``db/schema.sql``

* defines the project tables
* stores user accounts
* stores favourites
* stores notification settings


Authentication - ``routes/authentication_routes.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key responsibilities:

* register
* login
* logout
* session lookup
* forgot password response
* login validation and simple rate-limit protection

Connected frontend:

* ``templates/pages/login_page.html``
* ``static/js/auth_handlers.js``


Home and favourites - ``routes/favourites_routes.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key responsibilities:

* get favourites
* save favourites
* build the ``/api/home-screen`` payload
* decide whether to show generic or favourite-driven content
* short-term cache repeated home-screen payloads per user and selected league
* invalidate cached home data when favourites change
* shape favourite player cards for the home page

Connected frontend:

* ``templates/pages/home_page.html``
* ``templates/pages/favourites_page.html``
* ``static/js/home_page_handlers.js``
* ``static/js/favourites_handlers.js``


Match data - ``routes/match_routes.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key responsibilities:

* live matches
* upcoming fixtures
* recent results
* league or team filtering
* route-level mapping of match data for the UI

Connected frontend:

* ``templates/pages/live_page.html``
* ``templates/pages/fixtures_page.html``
* ``templates/pages/results_page.html``
* ``static/js/match_page_handlers.js``


Standings and statistics - ``routes/statistics_routes.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key responsibilities:

* league standings
* team statistics
* player statistics
* a dedicated Statistics page for individual team and player views
* standings lookup used by the homepage and league screens
* official team-statistics path plus recent-match fallback
* route-level caching for assembled team and player stat payloads

Connected frontend:

* ``templates/pages/leagues_page.html``
* ``templates/pages/compare_page.html``
* ``static/js/comparison_handlers.js``
* ``static/js/league_search_handlers.js``


Search and resolution - ``routes/lookup_routes.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key responsibilities:

* health check
* search endpoint
* resolve team endpoint
* resolve player endpoint
* resolve league endpoint
* shared helper functions for name matching and API-friendly resolution
* short-lived caches for repeated league, team, and player resolution results

Why it matters:

* this file is one of the most important pieces in the app because many UI features depend on turning free text into IDs safely


Profile and notifications - ``routes/profile_routes.py``, ``routes/notification_routes.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``routes/profile_routes.py``

* load profile data
* update profile fields
* change password

``routes/notification_routes.py``

* load notification settings

External football API integration - ``services/football_api_client.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key responsibilities:

* define supported endpoint mappings
* make HTTP requests to API-Football
* add request headers
* cache selected responses in memory
* back off after rate-limit responses
* retry with supported seasons after plan restrictions
* format standings
* compute team stats from finished matches
* fetch per-fixture advanced statistics used by FR7 team metrics

Why it matters:

* this is the main boundary between PrimeScore and the external football API
* many routes stay simpler because this file centralizes common API behaviour


Layout and page shell - ``templates/base_layout.html``, ``templates/dashboard_page.html``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``templates/base_layout.html``

* global page structure
* includes header, sidebar, footer, and scripts

``templates/dashboard_page.html``

* includes all page sections into one shell
* login, home, live, fixtures, results, leagues, compare, favourites, settings, and profile are all mounted here


Shared partials - ``templates/partials/``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Important files:

* ``site_header.html``
* ``site_sidebar.html``
* ``site_footer.html``
* ``app_scripts.html``

These partials keep shared UI structure out of individual page fragments.


Page sections - ``templates/pages/``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Important files:

* ``login_page.html``
* ``home_page.html``
* ``live_page.html``
* ``fixtures_page.html``
* ``results_page.html``
* ``leagues_page.html``
* ``compare_page.html``
* ``favourites_page.html``
* ``settings_page.html``
* ``profile_page.html``

Each file represents a feature area rendered inside the main dashboard layout.


Frontend scripts - ``static/js/``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Important files:

* ``app_helpers.js``

  * shared client-side utilities, state helpers, and memoized lookup fetch logic

* ``ui_helpers.js``

  * small shared UI helper functions

* ``auth_handlers.js``

  * registration, login, logout, session checks

* ``home_page_handlers.js``

  * home screen rendering, favourite player cards, league switcher behaviour

* ``favourites_handlers.js``

  * favourites form, saving, and summary updates

* ``match_page_handlers.js``

  * live, fixtures, and results page behaviour

* ``comparison_handlers.js``

  * team and player comparison behaviour

* ``stats_handlers.js``

  * dedicated Statistics page searches, stat requests, and rendering

* ``notification_handlers.js``

  * notification settings form

* ``profile_handlers.js``

  * profile editing and password change flows

* ``league_search_handlers.js``

  * league resolution and standings search

* ``navigation_handlers.js``

  * page switching and sidebar behaviour

* ``app_bootstrap.js``

  * starts the client-side app


Common problems
---------------

``psql`` is not recognized
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PostgreSQL command-line tools are not in your PATH.


PowerShell does not accept ``export``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use:

.. code-block:: powershell

   $env:FOOTBALL_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"


The app starts but football data is missing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check:

* ``FOOTBALL_API_KEY`` is set
* the key is valid
* the free API plan has not rate-limited you
* the daily request quota has not been exhausted


The app opens but the browser shows stale UI behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hard refresh:

.. code-block:: text

   Ctrl + F5


Fixtures or current-season data look empty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This can be caused by API-Football plan limits rather than by local code errors. Some routes depend on the seasons and query types allowed by the current plan.


Note
----

PrimeScore is still under active development. The backend foundation, testing, and documentation are now much stronger, but the project can still be improved further with:

* more browser-based end-to-end testing
* fuller API quota and plan-limit messaging
* more frontend automation
* more documentation split across dedicated docs pages if the repository later moves to GitHub Pages or Read the Docs
